# 🎬 AI-Powered Media Tracker (AppSheet + Gemini AI)

**A Technical Product Management & QA Showcase**

This repository demonstrates a full-cycle product approach to building an AI-integrated mobile app tool. It moves from high-level strategy and PRDs to technical implementation via Google Gemini and robust QA documentation.



## 🌟 The Vision
To eliminate manual data entry in personal media tracking. By leveraging the **Gemini 3 API**, this application transforms a simple "Title" input into a rich, metadata-heavy entry, automatically populating release dates, ratings, and synopsis.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **AI Auto-Population:** Real-time metadata fetching via Apps Script and Gemini.
- **Dynamic Dashboards:** UX optimised for mobile-first tracking in AppSheet.
- **Automated Workflows:** Logic-gate implementation to handle "Movie Not Found" scenarios.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **/docs**: Contains the **PRD**. This reflects my strategic thinking and ability to define "The What."
- **/scripts**: Contains the **Gemini Integration logic**. This reflects my technical depth as a TPM who understands API architecture.
- **/tests**: Contains the **Test Plan** and **Bug Templates**. This reflects my QA expertise in ensuring 99.9% platform stability.

## 📈 Business Impact (The "PM" Angle)
- **Efficiency:** Reduced user data entry time by **90%** through AI automation.
- **Retention:** Higher user engagement due to the "Calendar View" utility.
- **Scalability:** The API-first architecture allows for easy expansion into "Book Tracking" or "Video Game Tracking."
